# ImageScraper

ImageScraper is a Python-based web scraping tool that automates the extraction and downloading of images from web pages. Using Selenium WebDriver and requests, it identifies image elements based on specified attributes (such as class names or XPath), retrieves their source URLs, and saves them locally. This project is useful for collecting images for research, machine learning datasets, or content archiving.
